# OzCharge App

### By Jason Allan 2022

## Overview

I don't own a Tesla or any other Electric Car, I drive a 1991 VE Commodore Omegarunning on petrol. I was discussing with my father-in-law about their recent popularity, the "fuel" economy and not wanting to drive across the Nullarbor Plain in one, and where exactly are the charging stations anyway.

This Charging Station App will answer the question of locating these charging stations in relation to your location via a map based API.

OzCharge is for exclusive use in Australia.
